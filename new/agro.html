            <h2>What is Agroforestry?</h2>
            <p>Agroforestry is a farming approach that blends trees and shrubs with crops and livestock to create a more productive and sustainable farm. Think of it as a way to make your farm work better by combining different types of plants and animals. Instead of having just fields of crops or pastures for livestock, you mix in trees and shrubs. This method offers several advantages that can improve both your farm's productivity and its health.</p>

                <h3>Improved Soil Quality</h3>
                <p>Trees have deep roots that can break up compacted soil and bring up nutrients from deeper layers. This makes the soil richer and better for growing crops. Additionally, fallen leaves and branches add organic matter to the soil, helping retain moisture and reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Erosion Control</h3>
                <p>Trees and shrubs act as a natural barrier that slows down rainwater, reducing the risk of soil erosion. Their roots hold the soil together, preventing it from being washed away and ensuring that your land remains productive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Shade and Temperature Regulation</h3>
                <p>Trees provide shade for crops and livestock, protecting them from intense midday sun and reducing heat stress. This creates a cooler environment, which can improve the overall well-being of livestock and enhance crop productivity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Increased Biodiversity</h3>
                <p>Planting different types of trees and shrubs encourages a wider range of animals, insects, and birds to visit your farm. This diversity can be beneficial as many of these creatures assist with pest control and pollination.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Economic Benefits</h3>
                <p>Trees can provide additional sources of income through fruit, timber, or firewood. By diversifying your farmâ€™s products, you reduce the risk of relying on just one source of income.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Better Water Management</h3>
                <p>Trees help with water retention by allowing rainwater to soak into the ground more effectively. Their roots create channels that help water penetrate deeper, reducing runoff and increasing water availability for crops.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Windbreaks</h3>
                <p>Planting rows of trees around your fields can reduce wind speed and protect your crops. This is especially valuable in areas prone to strong winds, helping to maintain soil health and reduce crop losses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Increased Farm Resilience</h3>
                <p>Agroforestry creates a more balanced and stable environment, making your farm better able to withstand challenges like pests, diseases, and climate variations. It improves overall farm resilience.</p>
