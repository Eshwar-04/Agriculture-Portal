            <h2>Common Agroforestry Practices</h2>
            <div class="practice-list">
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Alley Cropping</h3>
                    <p>This involves planting rows of trees or shrubs between rows of crops. The trees provide shade and windbreaks, improve soil health through leaf litter, and can produce additional income from fruits or timber.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Silvopasture</h3>
                    <p>In this method, trees are integrated into pastures where livestock graze. The trees provide shade and shelter for the animals, which can improve their health and productivity. They also enhance soil fertility and reduce soil erosion.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Agroforestry Gardens</h3>
                    <p>This technique combines a variety of plants, including trees, shrubs, and vegetables, in a single plot. The diversity can increase yield and resilience, as different plants support each other through nutrient cycling and pest control.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Windbreaks</h3>
                    <p>Rows of trees are planted along the edges of fields to protect crops from strong winds. This reduces soil erosion and prevents damage to crops, while also conserving moisture.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Riparian Buffers</h3>
                    <p>Trees and shrubs are planted along waterways to protect water quality. These buffers reduce runoff and filter pollutants, preventing soil erosion and maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Boundary Planting</h3>
                    <p>Trees are planted along the boundaries of fields or properties. This can provide wind protection, reduce erosion, and mark property lines. It also offers habitat for wildlife.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Taungya System</h3>
                    <p>This traditional method involves planting trees in a crop field. The crops are grown while the trees are young, providing benefits such as shade and improved soil fertility until the trees mature and are eventually harvested.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-item">
                    <h3>Forest Farming</h3>
                    <p>This technique involves growing high-value specialty crops under the canopy of a forest or wooded area. Examples include medicinal herbs, mushrooms, or ornamental plants, which thrive in the shaded forest environment.</p>
